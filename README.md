BLAKE10
=======

This is an extremely simple game I quickly hacked together for the amusement of
my (2 year old) son, Blake.

It is so-called because 10 is his favourite number.

It helps him learn numbers and letters, and also how to use the computer
keyboard.

As written, it will only work on Mac OS X, since it is using AppleScript for
quick and dirty text-to-speech.

It should work on other operating systems if the text-to-speech code is removed
(or replaced with a cross-platform text-to-speech library, such as FreeTTS).
