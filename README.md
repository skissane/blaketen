BLAKE10
=======

This is an extremely simple game I quickly hacked together for the amusement of
my (2 year old at the time I originally wrote this) son, Blake.

It was so-called because 10 was his favourite number.

It helped him learn numbers and letters, and also how to use the computer
keyboard.

As originally written, it only worked on Mac OS X, since it was using AppleScript for
quick and dirty text-to-speech.

Since then, I've added Windows SAPI integration, so it worked on Windows.

And even more recently, I replaced the TTS with sound files I generated using TTS.
So now it doesn't depend on having TTS available at all.
