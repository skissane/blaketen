# Generated sounds

These sounds were generated using Apple's Karen (`en_AU`) voice, running on
macOS 10.14.6.

I admit I don't completely understand the legalities of generated speech. I'm
not sure if Apple legally can claim copyright on any of these files or not. I
think my contribution is too trivial to meet the originality bar required by
copyright law, but to the extent I do have any copyright interest in them, I
hereby relinquish that to the public domain.

I am just doing this "to create your own original content and projects for your
personal, non-commercial use" (to quote section F of [macOS
10.14](https://www.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/macOS1014.pdf) EULA), so I think I
am legally fine. Anyway, if anyone has any concerns, just replace these files
with some generated with some other text-to-speech service which has more
permissive licensing, such as Amazon Polly or [Google Cloud Text to
Speech](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/38171/can-i-use-the-sound-files-generated-by-the-google-cloud-text-to-speech-freely)
